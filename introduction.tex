- Experimentation of deep learning technique for localization in a natural environment
- Goal: obtaining a seasonal invariant and light invariant representation of natural environment images
- Unique dataset 
- Two different approaches: classification and regression
- Starting point: testing a network (CaffeNet) which performs well on classification task for well known datasets such as ImageNet.

- Classification: ...
- Regression: we try to learn the model that match the image to the GPS coordinates which can allow to identify a place robustly.
