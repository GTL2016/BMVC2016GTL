\subsection{Regression}

- Gaussian initialization of weights had to be tuned so that the convolution layers pass information to the fully connected layers (variances and biases)
- Learning rate adaptation depending of the nature of the layer (fc or conv).
- Weight decay
- Tests after loading the weights from the classification
- Influence of the dropout layer

Tests results to include :

Learning from scratch with projection in labels :
Machine 191: Tests 31, 34, 35, 36
Machine 193: Tests 34, 35, 26(bad filters but good loss)

Learning with pre-trained weights :
Machine 191: Test 30

Learning with angle label :
Machine 193: Test 37
