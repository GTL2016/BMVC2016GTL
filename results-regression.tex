\subsection{Regression}

- Gaussian initialization of weights had to be tuned so that the convolution layers pass information to the fully connected layers (variances and biases)
- Learning rate adaptation depending of the nature of the layer (fc or conv).
- Weight decay
- Tests after loading the weights from the classification
- Influence of the dropout layer
