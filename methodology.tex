Labels:
- We need the label to include the information on the position and angle of the view
- 4 dimensions labels (coordinates of the robot + coordinates of the point we are looking at on the shore)
- Normalization issues: The solution was to recenter and rescale the labels in [0,1].
- Datasets creations: Same as for the classification we built our datasets with images from the most highly represented classes. By taking a given number of images from each highly represented class we make sure that no class is overly represented so that we do not induce bias.

Loss:
- Euclidean loss, made possible because our labels were homogeneous

Network structure: 
- CaffeNet (a replication of the model described in the AlexNet publication) that performs well for classification tasks (on the ImageNet dataset).
- Accuracy layer is irrelevant on a regression problem so we removed it (the loss is our accuracy indicator)
- We changed the loss layer to the euclidean loss layer

Implementation:
- Framework Caffe: easy to use for the usual cases, python wrapper
- Not directly adapted for our problem: float labels, multilabel regression
- Can work with some tricks
- We would not recommend Caffe for similar problems
